Bugs:
timer state desyncs under some conditions - also timer object doesn't always load - maybe port some to dash?
Names can be too long and screw up subtitle rendering?
First point should appear somehow
Iphones fail
Pause should fade on timer not hover/active
Server errors should prompt for refresh
Rules page should display when you start


bonus reqs:
Pre-entry bet (where do you think you're at? where do you think other person will be at?)
Pre-party update bet (where do you think we're all at?)
inventory system
card playing system
